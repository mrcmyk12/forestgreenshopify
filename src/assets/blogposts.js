            "Minimizing your waste sounds like it can be difficult.  And I get it.  You’re accustomed to living a certain way and your life has been filled with things that you love that aren’t exactly the best for the environment.",
            "So you might wonder, how do I get started?  Can it be expensive?  And how much will it impact my day?",
            "These are fantastic questions and I asked myself those questions when I first (and as I continue) to go on this journey.  So let’s tackle the first question…how do I get started?",
            "Getting started is relatively easy, because it consists of following the principles of Reducing, ReUsing, and Recycling.  You’ve heard these principles before, but let’s see them in action.",
            "Reducing means cutting down on using the things you don’t need or avoiding them all together.  For example, try not to use single use plastic whenever possible.  Washing your clothes only when they are dirty and use cold water to wash them.",
            "So try to stay away from plastic straws (bring your own reusable silicon or bamboo straw), coffee filters and plastic k-cups (make pour-over coffee  or use reusable coffee filters).  And there are a multitude of other things that we use in our everyday lives, that we either don’t need or that we can substitute with something that is more sustainable.",
            "Reusing means using things over and over again…obviously.  So that means bringing reusable (produce and shopping) bags to the store.  Bring your own mug to the coffee shop instead of using disposable coffee cups.  Bringing your own cutlery with you when you go places instead of using disposable spoons and forks.",
            "Also you can pack your own lunch in order to avoid using food packaging which is usually one-use plastic.  Also, find a way to up-cycle your old clothes and fabrics.  You can make them into cleaning rags or sew them into reusable bags. ",
            "And finally recycling.  Recycling can be tricky because only 9% of the plastics are actually recyclable.  The other 91% is either burned or ends up in landfills and large bodies of water.  So try to avoid plastics whenever you can, using the aforementioned methods.",
            "Also you should properly dispose of old electronics (cell phones, tablets, computers, etc.).  Some of these items can still be upcycled and used by someone less fortunate.  Composting is a fantastic way to dispose of food waste and then upcycle it to regrow new vegetables.",
            "So this is a brief guide on how to start living a minimal waste lifestyle.  Remember, it’s not going to happen overnight.  And you have to be patient with yourself.  Don’t worry about being perfect, just making small changes everyday can make a big difference."
